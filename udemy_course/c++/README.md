# TCP Socket Programming Implementation Version v1

This project demonstrates a synchronous (blocking) TCP client-server implementation in C++ using Berkeley Sockets API. The implementation showcases fundamental network programming concepts and socket communication patterns.

## Full-Duplex Communication Explained

### What is Full-Duplex?
Full-duplex communication means that both the client and server can send and receive data simultaneously over the same connection. In our implementation, this is achieved through:

1. **TCP Socket Nature**
   - TCP sockets are inherently full-duplex
   - Each socket has separate send and receive buffers
   - Data can flow in both directions independently

2. **Implementation Example**
```cpp
// Server side
while(true) {
    // Can receive data from client
    recv(client, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    
    // Can send data to client
    send(client, message, strlen(message), 0);
}

// Client side
while(true) {
    // Can send data to server
    send(serverSock, message.c_str(), message.length(), 0);
    
    // Can receive data from server
    recv(serverSock, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
}
```

3. **Key Characteristics**
   - Bidirectional data flow
   - Independent send and receive operations
   - No need to wait for one direction to complete
   - Both parties can communicate simultaneously

4. **TCP Socket Features Enabling Full-Duplex**
   - Separate send and receive buffers
   - Independent flow control for each direction
   - No inherent direction restrictions
   - Built-in acknowledgment mechanism

## Understanding Message Flow and Blocking Behavior

### Current Implementation Behavior
When a client sends multiple messages in quick succession, the server processes them one at a time in a sequential manner. This is due to the blocking nature of socket operations.

### Message Flow Example
```
Client sends "Hello"
↓
Server receives "Hello" (recv blocks until data arrives)
↓
Server processes "Hello"
↓
Server sends response (send blocks until data is sent)
↓
Server can now receive next message
```

### Why Messages Are Processed Sequentially
1. **Blocking Socket Operations**
   - `recv()` blocks until data is available
   - `send()` blocks until data is sent
   - Each operation must complete before the next begins

2. **TCP Buffer Behavior**
   - TCP maintains send and receive buffers
   - Second message is stored in TCP receive buffer
   - Server's `recv()` is blocked until first message cycle completes
   - That's why second message appears only after server responds to first

### Impact on Application
1. **Current Limitations**
   - Messages are processed sequentially
   - No parallel processing
   - Poor responsiveness
   - Inefficient resource usage

2. **Real-world Implications**
   - Not suitable for high-load applications
   - Poor user experience
   - Limited scalability
   - Resource underutilization

### Solutions to Improve Message Handling

1. **Non-blocking Sockets**
   ```cpp
   // Set socket to non-blocking mode
   int flags = fcntl(sockfd, F_GETFL, 0);
   fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
   ```

2. **I/O Multiplexing**
   ```cpp
   // Using select to check for data
   fd_set readfds;
   FD_ZERO(&readfds);
   FD_SET(sockfd, &readfds);
   
   if (select(sockfd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL) > 0) {
       // Data is available to read
       recv(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
   }
   ```

3. **Separate Threads**
   ```cpp
   // One thread for receiving
   void receiveThread() {
       while(true) {
           recv(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
           // Process received data
       }
   }
   
   // Another thread for sending
   void sendThread() {
       while(true) {
           // Send data when available
           send(sockfd, data, strlen(data), 0);
       }
   }
   ```

### When to Use Current Implementation
1. **Suitable For**
   - Simple client-server applications
   - Low traffic scenarios
   - When simplicity is more important than performance
   - Learning and testing purposes

2. **Not Suitable For**
   - High-load applications
   - Real-time communication
   - Multiple client handling
   - Performance-critical systems

## Current Implementation (Synchronous/Blocking)

### Blocking Operations
- `send()` and `recv()` functions are blocking operations
- Server's `recv()` waits until client sends data
- Client's `recv()` waits until server sends data
- Creates a "ping-pong" effect where each side waits for the other

### Technical Terms
- **Synchronous I/O**: Operations block until completion
- **Blocking Sockets**: Socket operations wait for completion
- **Full-duplex Communication**: Both sides can send and receive
- **TCP Socket**: Connection-oriented, reliable communication
- **Stream Socket**: Byte-stream oriented communication

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Client Handling**
   - Only one client connection at a time
   - No concurrent client support

2. **Blocking Operations**
   - Limits scalability
   - Resource underutilization
   - Poor performance under load

3. **Missing Features**
   - No timeout mechanisms
   - No error recovery
   - No connection pooling

## Technical Architecture

### Communication Model
- **Synchronous (Blocking) I/O**
  - Socket operations block until completion

  - `recv()` blocks until data is received
  - Single-threaded execution model

### Protocol Stack
- **Transport Layer**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
  - Connection-oriented
  - Reliable delivery
  - In-order packet delivery
  - Flow control
  - Congestion control

### Socket Types

## Implementation Details

### Server Implementation
```cpp
// Socket Creation
server = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Address Configuration
serverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;  // Bind to all interfaces
serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;          // IPv4
serverAddr.sin_port = htons(5555);        // Port in network byte order

// Socket Operations
bind(server, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr));
listen(server, 5);                        // Backlog queue of 5
client = accept(server, NULL, NULL);      // Blocking call
```

### Client Implementation
```cpp
// Socket Creation
serverSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Address Configuration
addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");  // Localhost
addr.sin_family = AF_INET;                      // IPv4
addr.sin_port = htons(5555);                    // Server port

// Connection Establishment
connect(serverSock, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
```

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Non-blocking I/O
```cpp
// Set socket to non-blocking mode
int flags = fcntl(sockfd, F_GETFL, 0);
fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
```
