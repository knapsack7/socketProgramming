# TCP Socket Programming Implementation Version v1

This project demonstrates a synchronous (blocking) TCP client-server implementation in C++ using Berkeley Sockets API. The implementation showcases fundamental network programming concepts and socket communication patterns.

## Full-Duplex Communication Explained

### What is Full-Duplex?
Full-duplex communication means that both the client and server can send and receive data simultaneously over the same connection. In our implementation, this is achieved through:

1. **TCP Socket Nature**
   - TCP sockets are inherently full-duplex
   - Each socket has separate send and receive buffers
   - Data can flow in both directions independently

2. **Implementation Example**
```cpp
// Server side
while(true) {
    // Can receive data from client
    recv(client, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    
    // Can send data to client
    send(client, message, strlen(message), 0);
}

// Client side
while(true) {
    // Can send data to server
    send(serverSock, message.c_str(), message.length(), 0);
    
    // Can receive data from server
    recv(serverSock, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
}
```

3. **Key Characteristics**
   - Bidirectional data flow
   - Independent send and receive operations
   - No need to wait for one direction to complete
   - Both parties can communicate simultaneously

4. **TCP Socket Features Enabling Full-Duplex**
   - Separate send and receive buffers
   - Independent flow control for each direction
   - No inherent direction restrictions
   - Built-in acknowledgment mechanism

## Current Implementation (Synchronous/Blocking)

### Blocking Operations
- `send()` and `recv()` functions are blocking operations
- Server's `recv()` waits until client sends data
- Client's `recv()` waits until server sends data
- Creates a "ping-pong" effect where each side waits for the other

### Technical Terms
- **Synchronous I/O**: Operations block until completion
- **Blocking Sockets**: Socket operations wait for completion
- **Full-duplex Communication**: Both sides can send and receive
- **TCP Socket**: Connection-oriented, reliable communication
- **Stream Socket**: Byte-stream oriented communication

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Client Handling**
   - Only one client connection at a time
   - No concurrent client support

2. **Blocking Operations**
   - Limits scalability
   - Resource underutilization
   - Poor performance under load

3. **Missing Features**
   - No timeout mechanisms
   - No error recovery
   - No connection pooling

## Technical Architecture

### Communication Model
- **Synchronous (Blocking) I/O**
  - Socket operations block until completion
  - `send()` blocks until all data is sent
  - `recv()` blocks until data is received
  - Single-threaded execution model

### Protocol Stack
- **Transport Layer**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
  - Connection-oriented
  - Reliable delivery
  - In-order packet delivery
  - Flow control
  - Congestion control

### Socket Types
- **Stream Sockets (SOCK_STREAM)**
  - Full-duplex communication
  - Byte-stream oriented
  - Guaranteed delivery
  - Connection-oriented

## Implementation Details

### Server Implementation
```cpp
// Socket Creation
server = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Address Configuration
serverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;  // Bind to all interfaces
serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;          // IPv4
serverAddr.sin_port = htons(5555);        // Port in network byte order

// Socket Operations
bind(server, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr));
listen(server, 5);                        // Backlog queue of 5
client = accept(server, NULL, NULL);      // Blocking call
```

### Client Implementation
```cpp
// Socket Creation
serverSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Address Configuration
addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");  // Localhost
addr.sin_family = AF_INET;                      // IPv4
addr.sin_port = htons(5555);                    // Server port

// Connection Establishment
connect(serverSock, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
```

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Non-blocking I/O
```cpp
// Set socket to non-blocking mode
int flags = fcntl(sockfd, F_GETFL, 0);
fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
```

### 2. I/O Multiplexing
- **select()**: Traditional method, limited scalability
- **poll()**: Improved version of select
- **epoll()**: Most efficient for Linux systems

### 3. Multi-threading
- Thread pool for client handling
- Concurrent client support
- Better resource utilization

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections
- **Keep-alive**: Maintain long-lived connections
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevent indefinite blocking
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection

## Advanced Concepts

### Event-driven Architecture
- React to I/O events
- Non-blocking operations
- Callback-based processing
- Efficient resource usage

### I/O Multiplexing
- Monitor multiple sockets
- Handle multiple clients
- Efficient event handling
- Reduced resource usage

### Connection Management
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections
- **Keep-alive**: Maintain connections
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevent blocking
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection
